1) Goes down then up then switches bit then down then starts cutting.
2) Tries to pick up less. Better path finding.
3) Smaller bit doesn't need to be used as much. Only in small angles. Not where the larger bit did not fit.
4) 1rst bit goes farther than second bit
5) Turn on Blower
6) Dont go so low at first
7) Add in a way to cut braille
