1) Speed up the small bits. Maybe only check x values with the points
    or check x values of points +- half of increment value. Currently
    does both and checks wayyy too many xs as every point it adds an x so 
    it can increase by only 1/1000 of increment at a time.
2) Make use of RefCell for caching
3) Remove statics.
4) Prepare next tool to be used after a tool switch
